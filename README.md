# PubMedQA LLM Project

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook-based solution for fine-tuning a language model on the **PubMedQA** dataset. The project uses **OpenAI**, **Pinecone**, and **LangChain** to enhance the model's capabilities for biomedical question answering.

### Dataset

The **PubMedQA** dataset is available on Hugging Face at [PubMedQA Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/qiaojin/PubMedQA). This dataset contains question-answer pairs from scientific literature in the PubMed database.

### Project Overview

This project fine-tunes a pre-trained language model using the **PubMedQA** dataset. It leverages **OpenAI** for model generation, **Pinecone** for vector storage, and **LangChain** for chaining language models to improve answering complex biomedical questions.
